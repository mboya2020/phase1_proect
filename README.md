# phase1_project
Phase_1 project was Microsofts business question that required me as the Data Scientist to make recommedations based on movies titles doing the best at the box_office
I started by importing libraries that would be useful in my analysis.Some of the packages include:pandas,seaborn and matplotlib
Loaded the data that contained the dataset which was to be explored.
Showed the dataset info
Cleaned the movie_gross dataset. by checking and visualizing the the missing values
From the visualization i realized that the column containing the forign gross values had 39% of missing values while domestic gross and studio had almost negligble
Instead of dropping the entire foreign gross column,i decided to drop the rows with missing values since 39% is a small percentage of the entire foreign gross column.
