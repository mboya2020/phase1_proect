# Microsoft Studio Video Content

## Description
Phase_1 project was Microsofts business question that required me as the Data Scientist to make recommedations based on movies titles doing the best at the box_office

- My project gives the head of Microsofts new studio insights based on the movie gross income of the best box office movie titles to create.
- The technologies i used visualizes the recommendations which will be helpful in the decision making

### Recommendations
 1. If Microsoft studio is targetting the International market-which will bring in more foreign gross: The head of Microsoft's new studio should consider the top 10 Movie Titles that brought in more foreign gross income.The top 10 movie titles are listed.

   i. If Microsoft studio is targetting the local market-which will bring in more domestic gross: The head of Microsoft's new studio should consider the top 10 Movie Titles that brought in more domestic gross income.The top 10 movie titles are as listed.

   ii. If Microsoft studio is targetting both the International and local markets-which will bring in more foreign and domestic gross: The head of Microsoft's new studio should cosider the top 10 Movie Titles that brought in more total gross income

2. There are 502 movie titles that are currently doing excellently/best at the market.But among these also the top tire (top 10) are also listed and therefore the head of Microsoft's new movie studio has the option of the best 10 of the top category 

3. The year 2017 realized the highest total gross.For Microsoft new movie studio to realize a similiar or higher total gross i recommend creating the same films that were created in the year 2017.

4. I also recommend Microsoft's new movie studio head to visit the studios that produced the top movies produced in 2017 to benchmark and see how the movies were created.

5. Creating Movie Titles that can be watched both locally and internationally is of the best interest to Microsoft new studio since an increase in domestic gross results in an increase in foreign gross as shown above.The new Microsoft studio would apprreciate a good return in  total gross,am i right?
